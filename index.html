    <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
    <h2>This is still a WIP, as you can see.</h2>
    <p>Go visit my <a href="https://github.com/eduz1">my GitHub</a> in the meantime.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working on a simple, lightweight Pokemon FRLG save viewer and editor. The scope can change in the
        near future.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I'm currently located in Mexico working as a Software Engineer, while also studying Japanese,
        guitar and Rust.</p>
